# üêâ Dragon Hatcher ‚Äì A Mobile Clicker Game

## Project Overview

**Dragon Hatcher** is a mobile game built using React Native and Expo that engages users in raising dragons from eggs to adulthood. The game features time-based progression, global state management, sprite animations, and persistent data storage to deliver an interactive and immersive user experience. Players begin with dragon eggs and watch them hatch into baby and then adult dragons over time. The game's real-time lifecycle progression encourages players to return regularly, while intuitive controls and engaging animations make the experience fun and rewarding. The architecture was designed with scalability in mind, allowing easy addition of new dragon types, lifecycle stages, and animations.
